# Sockets in python

## Description üìÑ

_This project uses sockets in python to stablish a communication between a server socket and a client socket._

Sockets and the socket API are used to send messages across a network. They provide a form of inter-process communication (IPC). The network can be a logical, local network to the computer, or one that‚Äôs physically connected to an external network, with its own connections to other networks.
